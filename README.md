# Credit Risk Classification
Module 20 Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis
* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
the financial information is about lending data, we want to predict loan status/labels.

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
variables to predict: loan_status, either 0 for healthy for 1 for high-risk

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
Stages of machine learning: After loading in data, created X and y values. y value (target value) is 'loan_status' and X included all features (loan_size	interest_rate	borrower_income	debt_to_income	num_of_accounts	derogatory_marks)
Then, split the data into testing and training values. Why?
Next, instantiated a logistic regression model to the data.Then, fit the model using training data. Then, predicted the test data on the model.
Using the test data, we then generate a confusion matrix. Why?
Also using test data, we generate a classification report. Why?
Also chose to do an accuracy score. Why?


## Results
- Model Accuracy: 0.99
- Model Precision: 1.00 for 'Healthy Loan', 0.85 for 'High Risk Loan'
- Model Recall: 0.99 for 'Healthy Loan', 0.91 for 'High Risk Loan'

## Summary
In summary, I would recommend this model to predict loan labels as it has shown that it performs well.
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
